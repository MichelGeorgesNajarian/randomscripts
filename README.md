## Python

### recursive_rename.py
coded and tested in Windows. ** Won't work in Linux since Windows uses '\' instead of '/' **

To run: if python.exe is in the PATH, just type:

`python.exe recursive_rename.py $root_directory` (replace $root_directory with your specific directory like _anime_ for example)

`[Horriblesubs] Boku no Pico - 01[1080p].mkv` will be renamed to `Boku no Pico - 01.mkv`

`(some_random_fansub_group) Dragon_Ball_GT_42 [potato].mkv` will be renamed to `Dragon Ball GT 42.mkv`
